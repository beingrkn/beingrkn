## About Me

I am still at the beginner stage of my journey, learning and creating new things every day. My interests revolve around Discord bots, Minecraft servers, and video games. I usually begin my day struggling to start a project from scratch — but the excitement of building keeps me going.

When I'm not working, I love investing time talking to new people on Discord, expanding my network, and sharing ideas.
